    "text": "And Jacob, I can't hear you saying words.  I can't hear you. I can't hear you.  Yeah, now I can.  Excellent. How are you?  Fantastic. Okay. I'm very sorry about that. I'm experiencing some technical difficulties. I hope you're doing well, and I hope you're having an excellent day. Today, I believe there are two students here that I'm working with today. Is that correct? Yeah. Is Ben the other one? Is he is he available? Is he here?  I think he's available, but just wait a minute.  Okay, we'll wait for him then. What's your name? Sorry, if I may ask?  Tungsten.  Tungsten. Nice to meet you. And you're here to work on your English writing. Is that correct?  Yeah.  Excellent. I believe I've had a look at your writing. And I was, I must say you have excellent handwriting.  Very, very good. My handwriting is atrocious. I believe your handwriting is probably better than mine.  Excellent. Okay, we'll give him one more minute. If he's here, great. If not, we'll make a start.  Okay. Yes, I do actually have your writing here. Let's see.  Perhaps the most important factor involved in becoming an elite athlete is their environment.  Alright, let's do another check. Hello, Ben, are you here?  a little bit higher.  What time is it over there?  m  Okay, excellent. Brilliant. Right. Today, we're going to talk about paragraphs and writing our paragraphs. Okay. Okay. I promise you this. It's not going to be too difficult. I've had a look at most of your writing. And I'm very, very impressed. And I think that we will have a lot of a lot of things to say. So are you guys aware of what topic sentences are?  topic sentences  Topic Sentences.  Any idea?  of power.  It's part of a paragraph. It's an element of a paragraph.  Yeah.  And what purpose does the topic sentence serve?  It's served to tell you what this paragraph is mainly about.  Fantastic. Excellent. So could you give me an example of a topic sentence?  There are many young people who like to play video games.  But are they good or bad for them?  There are a lot of young people who like to play video games.  But is that good or?  I mean for them.  Okay, excellent. Right. Fantastic. Now, Ben, would you be able to give me an example of a topic sentence?  the show of this team is very fantastic is this the greatest show you've ever seen?  What's the show name again one more time?  The show of this team is fantastic!  is fantastic. Yes.  Okay, it's good to start with a rhetorical question.  Can you put the words together?  Yeah, absolutely.  Okay, now these are decent, but they're not good topic sentences. They're good thesis statements.  Okay, do you know what a thesis statement is?  You know what the thesis statement is? The difference between a thesis statement and a topic sentence?  I don't know. What does this...  Well, I don't know. This is just a statement. I don't know what it is.  So the topic sentence is for a paragraph. The thesis statement  is about the text as a whole. Okay, okay, so it's actually  about the whole essay or the whole piece. Okay, let's say for  example, that I'm writing a piece, let's use the first idea  video games, the central statement, or the question is  video games good or bad. Okay, excuse my handwriting. Right.  And then of that text, there's going to be three paragraphs.  Going to be three paragraphs. Yes.  Now in those paragraphs we have as you know the topic sentence.  That's in the paragraph. So we start the paragraph with the topic sentence. So for example, we could say, firstly, video games have a good effect on hand-eye coordination. Right? This is a good start to a paragraph. This is a good topic sentence. So it fits here. Okay. So video games are good for hand-eye coordination. Okay, let's make this indented.  Secondly, video games may be a distraction for students. And finally, video games may cause  health problems such as poor posture, hypertension, and a sedentary lifestyle.  Okay, now each of these can be turned into paragraphs.  We can have a whole paragraph with lots of detail  about anti-coordination.  This is a topic sentence.  Okay, so let's label this paragraph one.  And then let's label this 3.  OK, with me so far.  So these are what are they?  the topic sentences. Exactly.  Exactly. Yes. So they're what's around the nucleus of the essay, there are the center, which is our video games good or bad. So this is the question we're answering. Okay, actually, if the way to improve the thesis statement is to actually come to a conclusion. So overall,  While video games may be entertaining and develop various skills,  There are dangers to one's health and development.  That one must be aware of.  Okay, so this is actually the thesis statement and this is the topic sentence.  We have to know the difference and I'll show you where they appear.  Okay, let's say we have a sample piece of writing, a very good one,  one that's going to get very good grades. Now here is the topic sentence.  Can you make it bigger?  Yeah, of course. So you see here paragraph one, the first topic sentence summarizes the idea discussed in the first paragraph into one sentence. Now, let's use another topic. Let's say that the topic I want to discuss is the second one mentioned here.  was not video games what was the other idea ah yes the greatest show the team has ever okay  let me think okay let's come up with a different topic let's come up with a topic that's easier to  art okay school trips are essential to student learning right so school trips outside the school  are essential to student learning can you guys give me an example topic sentence we can use here  For example, in some trips, the teachers take students to libraries.  Can expand the students knowledge.  Excellent. Ben, could you give me a potential topic sentence about this topic here?  Probably sometimes the students will go to the.  park and learn how to draw or the knowledge about the animal.  There's one slight grammar mistake here.  So instead of the, we say gain knowledge about the animal.  OK.  You guys remember.  Knowledge is a noun, there has to be some verb that goes along with it,  otherwise the sentence doesn't make sense, the knowledge about the animal.  So what happens to the knowledge about the animal?  Well, the knowledge is gained by the student.  Or gain knowledge about the animal.  OK, let's improve this just a little bit.  Remember, don't start with the example.  Start with the idea.  So the essential idea in this first statement here,  is that the students gain knowledge, so start with this.  So the students may gain crucial knowledge from these trips, for example.  So this is actually not the topic sentence.  This is the development, this is the evidence.  It goes under it.  But the actual topic sentence.  ive students gaining this knowledge okay similarly a  ike knowledge about the item. Okay, why is it important? Let  e me ask you this, I'm going to challenge you here a little bit  ight? Why is it important that they gain knowledge about a  n animal, or they learn how to draw? Why is this important?  Well, mainly it's important because drawing and knowledge about analytical knowledge,  it can be used when you are going to find schools and you need to do some tests,  then you can get good grades, something like that.  Okay, decent. Yes.  And also, it can gain you new knowledge when you are bored.  And you can think of these and draw or read books about the animal and such,  and not be flummoxed by all those meanings.  That's true. But remember, a good topic sentence addresses the thesis statement in the terms of the thesis statement.  So if you use these terms in your response, that's going to make the topic sentence really good.  But very good ideas, Kaksan. I really like the developments you have to your ideas.  That's going to be good when we're developing the paragraph itself.  So the later parts, so sentence two, sentence three, sentence four, what you said is going to be very good.  However, Ben, I'm going to ask you this.  The students may gain crucial knowledge from these trips.  Okay, so I'm gonna I'm gonna add to this I'm gonna make it a good example which is essential.  Here I've used the terms of the topic. So don't be scared to look at the question you get and  use the words they use in your response. Now I want you to turn this into something that looks  like this. I want you to develop your suggestion here okay into something very very sharp. So  why is it important let's work through step by step why is it important they learn how to draw  or gain knowledge. Coxon actually partially answered this.  I think if they are going to find out a good school that they want to go to, probably if they  are interested in drawing or the animal, they need to find out the more knowledge of the animal and  how to draw, then they can have a probably good high school.  Okay, so we're getting closer to a good idea. Don't tell me it's  we're gonna have a good discussion about this. So Ben,  we're getting closer to a good idea here. We need to make the  sentence a bit better. We're almost there. Okay. So if  they're going to find a good school, if they're interested in  drawing the animal, we need to find out more knowledge about  the animal and then they can have a good high school. So do  you mean that they, for example, have a good high school  experience or they enter a good high school? What do you mean  that they enter a good high school?  Enter a good high school.  Exactly. So you have to use the exact words because if you say they can have a good high school, there's two possible meanings. And you don't mean both. You mean one, you mean enter. So we need to be clear about language we use. Okay, so if they're going to enter a good high school, okay, so why is it important that they have knowledge of the animal?  Maybe when they enter the school, the school is going to test them.  So how does the school trip?  And how does the school trip make sure that they have the knowledge?  If they go to the park, they can find out more wild animals and the teacher probably  will tell more knowledge of this animal to them.  Let's make this general though. So this is very specific. Do you know what I mean when I say this is very specific?  The difference between specific and general.  You have to be able to speak in both general and specifics. So are they only going to be tested on animals?  What else will they be tested? They'll be tested on a large number of subjects, correct?  Yes, probably.  I'm a physics, chemistry, biology now. Okay, Coxon wants  to say something. Okay, yes.  I think that means about you learn good about this and you can  well be a specialist in it and you can get a school. Sometimes people do that.  That's true. But we have but see, this is a good idea we're  speaking about. But our job now is to make sure that the reader  gets the exact same idea that's in our minds. Okay. So yes,  that's, that's a very good point. Coxon is saying what I'm trying  to say, yes. But now how do we put this in writing in a way so  that everyone who reads this is going to understand what I mean?  Okay, so let's let's keep let's keep a few things in mind. So do  school trips only prepare you for one subject? Or can they  prepare you for all subjects?  and prepare you for subjects of fact, no subject have a lot of people or more  Excellent, yes, very good. They could potentially prepare you for all subjects. So we don't need to limit ourselves to animals. So let's speak in general terms. Okay, let's not focus on animals. How do we say that school trips can enhance our knowledge in a lot of subjects, therefore, increasing the chances of entering a good high school? How do we say this in one sentence? Can someone make an attempt?  Difficult, right? Yeah. But this is the process of writing, you have to be able to say it in one  sentence.  Any ideas?  What section?  Now I noticed that neither of you are using pen and paper.  It's difficult to think like this. This type of thinking is impossible because we're limited by our short term memory.  Okay, if you're limited to your short term memory, these complex sentences, the type I'm trying to get you to articulate today, it's impossible even for a super genius.  Use pen and paper. Use these tools to allow you to craft a perfect sentence. Write and write and write and improve.  Okay, if you have ideas, I can write them on the screen so that you can process multiple ideas at once.  So if you want me to make a note, let me know.  Remember, we're trying to say that school trips prepare students for many subjects and therefore  increase their chances of entering high school. So how do we say that?  Okay, I'm going to stop you guys in five seconds.  Okay, I saw Ben raises hands and then kaksan raises hands. So I'm going to ask you both and I'm going to write down what both of you say. Okay. All right, kaksan. Let's start with you.  So trophies can expand your knowledge of a lot of subjects.  a chance for a good hospital.  Now there are some errors here, but we'll address them after I hear Ben's sentence. Okay, Ben. Do you have an idea?  My sentence is, the school trip can prepare a large number of subjects which can help students  to enter a good high school.  I know. I think I will add which.  You think you'll add what, sorry?  which will boost. Okay, good. Yes. That's you fixed one mistake  already. Good trips can expand your what kind of trips? Be  specific school trips. Yes. can expand your knowledge of a lot  of subjects.  Several subjects because lots of subjects doesn't.  so has  What's your chances of what's a high good high school? Entering a good high school.  All right. Now there's a missing link here.  Okay, because the sentence needs to be complete. You didn't tell me how the school trips can boost  your chances of entering a good high school. Okay, so kongsan, I need you to be thinking about this  while I speak to Ben, okay. And I've left x, y, z here as to where you can add this final idea.  Remember, the topic sentence of a paragraph has to have everything. And if it's missing something,  you're going to be losing marks. Okay, right, Ben. So this sentence here, the school trips, or it's  not the school trip, is it one school trip or school, multiple school trips in general?  School trips.  Good. School trips, more than one.  Good can prepare a large number of subjects. No. First of all, who are you preparing? Who's being prepared? The teachers?  for the students.  can prepare students now is it preparation are you going for the trip to prepare for an exam or  is it to add preparing means to yes so we're not preparing for something right so what's  the school trips doing yes they're adding to what so  Add to students.  adding to the students some kinds of subject.  Are they adding so I if they're studying seven subjects, they'll be studying 10 subjects? Is that what you mean?  Several subjects.  No, but you can't say just adding to the subject, because  that means they're studying more subjects. This doesn't make  sense. It's like they're studying math, physics,  chemistry. And then if you add subjects, they're studying math,  physics, chemistry and English. You have to be specific. So what  are you adding? Are you adding to their wealth? Are you adding  to their health? Are you adding to their knowledge? Are you  adding? What are you adding?  knowledge knowledge  Yes, to the students knowledge.  Okay, now a large number of subjects knowledge of a large, there's a missing one here, but it's fine because it's not your fault because we just added this knowledge of a large number of subjects. Okay, again, it doesn't mention how. So I'm going to write x, y, z here.  I want you to think about it.  Okay, which can help students enter  a good high school this part's fine. I'll leave this for now. But again, it's missing now.  Sorry, not done yet!  Okay.  about half of it but still as i had just got the as the more subjects you learn and then i still  had the blah blah blah right  No, it's not the more subjects you learn. Again, you have to be careful here because the more subjects you learn means you're studying more subjects. It's like you have your existing subjects and now you're adding archaeology, which is not what we want to say. We want to be precise. Writing is a precise endeavor. So we're going to work on this together. Okay. So school trips can expand your knowledge of several subjects. Now, when you go to the school trip, talk me through it. How does learning happen on a school trip?  It's like, probably.  It tells you to go somewhere and takes you there.  Then you can learn a lot of things about where it is and where the teacher will most likely  ban launch about history and culture.  But that doesn't actually have to happen on a trip. All of these things can happen in a classroom. The teacher can babble in the classroom.  So, when you went to a trip, the more chances is that the teacher takes you to a museum or some place to play.  And in the museum, you can learn about the history.  And to play, the place to play, you can learn more skills about...  Sometimes when you go there, you need to spend a few days there.  It's like how to do your things yourself.  Okay, I want you to work on that. Because you're getting close. But your  calculation isn't there. Because I need to ask Ben. All right. Is that okay? Just  give me one second. I'll come back to you. Alright, Ben. What do you think?  I think that if you go on a school trip, probably you can have another kind of way to learn this knowledge.  Not so... Not...  borring in a classroom so it will make the students learn the knowledge easily.  Yes, good. We can now this is the type of thing I want you to  write and make a note of on pen and paper, and then improve it.  Because the articulation may not be there. There is probably a  better way to say this, but the idea is good. Yes, you're  talking about multiple ways of learning. This is very good.  Excellent. And Coxon, you were getting close to this, but I  think you also have a different idea. I want to hear that one as  well. So, Ben, I want you to look at this sentence, and I want  you to improve it. Can you do that? Yeah. Okay, excellent.  Alright. In the meantime, let me just very quickly speak to  Coxon. So Coxon, right. Any idea about how to articulate your  idea better?  or subjects. Also you can learn multiple schools for some classes that you will learn in the future.  Excellent. But we need to focus on how the knowledge enters the students mind.  This is the point. This is the X, Y, Z.  OK, so I'm going to help you out here.  And usually, when you're on the trip, the teacher tells you about literature in a kind of way that isn't, which is in a kind of way different. It's like in a kind of way different from the classroom learning.  Okay, so I'm going okay, cocks on I'm gonna help you out here because you said it. You said it's what you haven't said it.  appealing, I think.  I'm giving you I'm giving you the I'm giving you the very good words I'm giving you the  best words  Conducive. You know what conducive means?  If you don't know, we highlight, we go here.  We can look at synonyms, favorable or encouraging,  or more positively contributing towards.  So I'm giving you this word.  Please write this down.  I think this will be a good sentence  for you to have as an example.  All right, Ben, let's take the sentence you wrote here.  Let's move it here.  Okay, Ben, let's hear your articulation.  Sorry, I'm very sorry, Kaksan.  I'm trying to keep your material on the screen as well  so you don't get left out.  So Kaksan, this is yours.  I'm gonna highlight it in light.  Okay, right, Ben.  Yeah?  Any idea as to how we can articulate this better?  I haven't got any idea but I think maybe I can have an example to explain it.  Good, but remember, the example comes later. That's sentence number 234. In sentence one,  you have to articulate the idea. Okay, what's another way to say not so boring?  Maybe the teacher will tell stories to the students.  That's a sentence, 2-3-4. Right now, what's another way to say, not so boring? Ignore  everything else, just focus on not so boring.  different in the school.  difference. What else?  I'll give you a word here, okay? I'll help you out. You could say exciting. You could say stimulating.  tu stable.  You could say, enriching. You could say dynamic. Dynamic means  constantly moving. Okay, let's go through them one more time.  So you can write them down. Exciting.  Exciting.  Yes, you could say dynamic.  You could say in Rachel.  Stimulating you could say enriching as well. That's the next.  Do you need more time to copy this? Let me know when you're done.  Okay, I'll give you a second. Sorry.  Okay, next one.  Excellent enriching.  These are all ways to say not so boring. So three words we've condensed into one. Okay. Okay. So this is why when we work on our vocabulary, when we have vocabulary, when we read, these words will come more easily to mind. Okay, I'm gonna give you a final one.  Stimulating, enriching, exciting, dynamic. There's many words but I don't want to give you the very large ones. You can have another kind of way to learn this knowledge. Let me think dynamic. I think if I click here and do the synonyms. Vibrant. Vibrant is good. Vibrant is more colorful. I'm gonna give you another one after vibrant. Let me know when you're done.  colorful, bright, loud, exciting, dynamic, enrich, stimulate, enthralling...  immersive... there's 100 different words we could use for not so boring... Ok?  we'll stop here just running out of time so you can have  through learning in a more.  Vibrant  Do you know what I mean when I say which will improve retention?  probably means it will make the students learn faster and easier.  To improve retention means to make it easier to remember. But if you want them to learn, if you want to include the idea of learning faster, what we can say instead is  Okay, vibrant environment, facilitating learning.  boosting students.  as I was venturing in high school.  And then we had there by. Okay, now, could you copy down this sentence?  Because this is your perfect sentence that we've worked on today.  Okay. And we've condensed all of this into a few words.  This is something that will come with time. All right,  excellent. Now, as a result of your very hard work, both of you  have managed to come up with very good, in my opinion, topic  sentences. What do you guys think of these topic sentences?  Still long but clear.  Having all the blob is still more effective.  We could make it even shorter. Could you believe me if I said you can condense both of these down into two lines?  You can believe that. Okay.  Make it clear.  There you go. Oh, there you go. Two lines. Okay. And next one.  If you can copy down this one, that will help.  School...  Usually I would have you guys condense them down, but we're running out of time, so I'm just trying to...  Alright, if you can just, oh, sorry. Why did I talk? Okay, sorry. It's very awkward zooming in and out.  I'm going to delete the long sentences just so you guys have space. There you go.  improved perfect topic sentence.  Okay, Ben, I think you finished copying the Cox and have you  finished copying this one down as well?  Now my mom has a little picture of it.  Okay, excellent. Yes, if you can take a screenshot and copy it  later, that'd be fine. But I'm more than happy to wait and  answer any questions if you have.  okay copy down  xtent. Now, I hope that today allowed you guys to see the  process of developing a good topic sentence. It doesn't just  come from the mind immediately. You can even see me take my  time, edit, cut, remove, erase, write, rewrite, condense. It's a  process. And so there needs to be space outside of the right of  the page you're writing like a scrap page for you to plan and  think and articulate and test and edit before you give a  polished and complete topic sentence. If your topic sentence  is strong, even if your paragraph is weak, the examiner  or the teacher is going to have a good first impression of your  paragraph. And even if you explain things poorly, they'll  be able to understand what it is you're trying to say. The topic  sentence is the most important element of the paragraph.  Mastering the topic sentence is crucial to mastering writing  itself.  Okay.  Excellent. Now, you guys have come up with one topic sentence. What I want from you guys,  before our next lesson, if the next lesson is to proceed, is I would like you guys to give me  two topic sentences.  Regarding this topic, if you'd like to take a screenshot now.  If you would like to take a screenshot now.  write two more topic sentences.  either in agreement or the su  All right, so I want two more.  of this quality orbiter.  Do you think that will be possible?  Of course it will be. Yes. Of course it will be possible.  Excellent. All right. Now, let me end my share screen. I'm  struggling to end my share screen. Stop share. Okay,  excellent. Fantastic. I am very happy with the work that you  guys have done today. I am very happy with your contributions.  Both of you are very articulate students and hard working  students. And you have a lot to say you have a lot of good  opinions. And I would like to work with you guys in the  future to help develop your learning and help develop your  writing. Because I can tell that you're both you both have a lot  of potential. Okay. Okay, we just need to make sure that  you're pushed very hard. And in the direction of conciseness and  precise articulation to take you to the next level. Okay. And  it's and this stuff isn't easy, by the way. It's one sentence,  but it's going to take you a long time, as you can tell, this  stuff is not easy. A lot of people really struggle with  this. So don't feel that Oh, you know, this is difficult. Don't  worry. If you persevere and you're determined and you work  hard, I promise you, you will probably be a better writer  than I am.  Okay.  Fingers crossed. Okay, I will leave you guys be Do you guys  have any questions before we end for today?  I have a question.  If I want to write a clear and sharp public sentence.  What am I going to do? Sometimes I don't understand it.  scrap piece of paper, a pen. And what we did today, we write  and we rewrite and rewrite and we cross out. And we shorten  certain statements and we make it really long and we condense  really long and edit. It's not easy. It doesn't come in the  first 10 seconds, you have to write 10 or 11 topic sentences.  And then you finally arrive at your proper one at first. As  your skill improves, you will spend less time planning. And  you will be able to write it in your first attempt, or maybe  second attempt. Okay, just  Just practice, right?  It's practice. Yes, even with the individual one, of course, you're not going to understand that first, no one is going to understand at first, anyone who says they understand exactly what they're going to say and write it in their first attempt is lying on the board, they're a top 1% writer. At first, it's going to be a messy process, it's going to be a difficult process, it's going to take time at first. But if you practice and you do it over and over and over again, it's going to take you less time and less effort.  But again, scrap piece of it's like mathematics. You know, in  mathematics, you have to have your working out and then you  have the final solution.  yeah i need to have a lot of use a lot of paper  Maybe one or two should suffice for one topic sentence one or two  sessions. I don't want you to have 100 pages around you. And  you still don't have a topic one or two should be fine. Maybe  three. Okay, but but this planning everything we've done  today is the working out. The topic sentence is the final  answer.  Rewrite and rewrite.  Exactly. Until it's better until it's perfect. And even  the sentence, the ones that we came up with today, there's  probably a way I can improve it. There's probably something we  can do. Kaizen, you know, continuous improvement.  For now, I will leave you guys be any other questions. Sorry,  before we enter today? No. Cocks on any comments, questions,  concerns.  Oh, one that.  I'm very sorry, I'm struggling to hear you, but I think there might be an echo.  The picture, a picture of time.  Yes, those are both me. It's the same. It's the same outfit, the same pose. Yes. That was me when I  was six years old. I was in Penang, Malaysia. And this is me at the University of Aberdeen for my  master's degree.  All times when you are learning not to...  Yeah, at six years old, I was in Malaysia, I was working very hard. And at 23 years old is when I finished my master's last year. There's a lot that's happened here. 13 different schools, eight different countries.  13 different schools.  13 different schools, sometimes two schools at once.  Yes, sometimes two schools at once. Five different five, five or six, six, including Scotland. Six different countries. Yes, a lot of a lot in between.  We'll discuss it hopefully another time. All right. Bye. Bye. Any other questions? No. No. All right. It was excellent meeting you guys today. Thank you very much for choosing to work with me. And hopefully I'll see you next time. Goodbye.  ?",
